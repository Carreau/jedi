"""
The ``Parser`` tries to convert the available Python code in an easy to read
format, something like an abstract syntax tree. The classes who represent this
tree, are sitting in the :mod:`jedi.parser.tree` module.

The Python module ``tokenize`` is a very important part in the ``Parser``,
because it splits the code into different words (tokens).  Sometimes it looks a
bit messy. Sorry for that! You might ask now: "Why didn't you use the ``ast``
module for this? Well, ``ast`` does a very good job understanding proper Python
code, but fails to work as soon as there's a single line of broken code.

There's one important optimization that needs to be known: Statements are not
being parsed completely. ``Statement`` is just a representation of the tokens
within the statement. This lowers memory usage and cpu time and reduces the
complexity of the ``Parser`` (there's another parser sitting inside
``Statement``, which produces ``Array`` and ``Call``).
